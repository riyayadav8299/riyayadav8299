Solution of this web assignment 

1. **Figma Design Analysis**:
   - Access the provided Figma design link.
   - Analyze the design for layout, typography, colors, images, and responsiveness.

2. **Setting Up Next.js Project**:
   - Initialize a new Next.js project using `npx create-next-app`.
   - Set up the project with TypeScript if required for better type checking.

3. **Component Breakdown and Directory Structure**:
   - Identify and create reusable components (header, footer, sections, buttons, etc.).
   - Organize the project using the following directory structure:
     - `components/`: Contains all reusable components.
     - `pages/`: Includes Next.js pages, which are built from components.
     - `styles/`: Contains CSS or styled-components files.
     - `public/`: Holds static assets like images and fonts.

4. **Development and Implementation**:
   - Start building the components by closely following the design specifications from Figma.
   - Utilize Next.js features like Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Static Site Generation (SSG) to optimize performance and SEO.

5. **Styling**:
   - Implement styles to match the Figma design using CSS modules or styled-components.
   - Ensure the design is responsive and looks good on various screen sizes.

6. **Hosting**:
   - Deploy the website on Vercel by connecting the GitHub repository to Vercel and selecting the project for deployment.
   - Verify the deployed site matches the Figma design.

7. **Submission Requirements**:
   - Prepare the GitHub repository with well-documented code and a `README.md` file explaining setup and local running.
   - Share the live link to the Vercel-hosted website.

8. **Evaluation Criteria**:
   - Double-check design accuracy, component design, directory structure, code quality, and hosting against the assignment criteria.
